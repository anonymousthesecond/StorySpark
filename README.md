## Story Generator: User Guide (C++)

This document provides a guide on using the story generator we built together in C++. It's important to note that this is a basic framework, and further development is needed for a fully functional story creation tool.

**1. Introduction**

This story generator is a C++ program that allows you to provide basic elements and see a story outline generated based on those elements. 

**2. System Requirements**

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming (recommended)

**3. Usage (Current Functionality)**

**3.1 Limitations**

- **Early Stage:**  This is an incomplete program, and the story generation capabilities are limited. 
- **Basic Outline:**  It can currently only generate a simple story outline with a few elements.
- **Manual Code Modification:**  To use it, you'll need to modify the code directly (not recommended for beginners).

**3.2 Code Structure (Optional):**

Here's a high-level overview of the code structure (understanding this is optional):

- The code might have functions or classes to represent story elements like characters, plot points, and settings.
- A core function might handle story generation logic based on provided elements. 

**3.3 Future Enhancements:**

- User Input:  The goal is to create a user interface where you can input story elements and receive a generated story.
- Story Complexity:  Future development aims to generate more intricate and detailed stories based on user input.

**4. Getting Started (Not Recommended for Beginners)**

**WARNING:**  Modifying code directly is not recommended for beginners. This section is for informational purposes only.

**4.1 Compiling the Code:**

1. Assuming the code is saved in a file named `story_generator.cpp`, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
2. Use a C++ compiler like `g++` to compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ story_generator.cpp -o story_generator  # Replace g++ with your compiler if needed
   ```

   This will create an executable file named `story_generator` (or the name you specify with `-o`).

**4.2 Running the Code (if applicable):**

1. In the same terminal, run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./story_generator  # Replace ./ with the path to your executable if needed
   ```

   **Note:**  Without a user interface, you'll likely need to modify the code directly to provide story elements and trigger story generation. This is not recommended for beginners.

**5. Future Development**

The focus will be on creating a user-friendly interface for story element input and displaying the generated story. Stay tuned for updates!

**6. Conclusion**

This user guide provides a basic overview of the story generator in its current state. While not fully functional yet, it serves as a foundation for a future interactive story creation tool.
